# Joget Technical Interview Question

This is the github for Joget Technical Interview Question.
It consists of all coding answer and features to open the file.

The IDE use to run the coding on web application is by using Visual Studio Code
and in my case I am using the codespace.All the answer coding sheet is in the joget file.

Before starting please install the Java extension pack, node.js extension pack and http-server pack.
To install http-server pack please run this command to install 'npm -g install http-server' and follow
the guide from https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/npm-command-not-found-http-server
Http-server folder is a folder to run the http-server command. To open the web application, please run command
'http-server' and open the desired html file. This is applicable for Q2 and Q4.

For Question 1, it was divided into 3 parts which are part a, part b and part c.
Kindly refer to the comment to identify each question and each answer for each part.
To run the java file, please run command java -filename.

For Q2, please run http-server. Select q2.html. Open console and click the button click here on display.
The result will be display in the console. First line is the 10 array of number from 1-1000 and the second
line is the total of the 10 array. The Q2.html is linked with random.js file. The javascript was written in there.

For Q3, go to joget.com. Open the console and paste the code from q3.js. The disappearing navbar will happen.

For Q4, the HTML file itself in the joget main folder but all the static files include the
photo and CSS file is located in static folder. Run the http-server and open the q4.html and it will diplay a
simple website for joget.com which the button is being linked to the original joget.com sites.

All the screenshot output is in folder printscreen_output.
